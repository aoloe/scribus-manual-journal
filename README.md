It contains:

This document is not:

- A general Scribus manual (we will refer you to other documents for details on some of the tasks).
- An intorduction in Desktop Publishing.

## Status

This document is still an early draft.

We need your help to define what are the needs that have to be met by Scribus to be usable for scientific journal.

There are multiple ways you can contribute to this document:

- Provide samples PDFs that we should be able to reproduce with Scribus (the document should be under a license that allows us to publish it in this repository)
- Sample Scribus documents that reproduce layouts for scientific journals.
- Content that we can publish as CC-BY-SA to illustrate this manual.

  - ...
- The first bits of this document are based on Opussci-Long questions in a [Reddit thread they created](https://old.reddit.com/r/scribus/comments/1m2jxl9/scribus_for_scholarlyscientific_typesetting/).  
  Here are the topics mentioned in there, that need to be integrated in this document:

  - [ ] Creating tables.

       - Page started.

  - [ ] Cross-referencing.
  - [ ] Creating, running and distributing scripts.
  - [ ] A dedicated dialog for inputting tables to be rendered with LaTeX.
  - [ ] Mathematic formulas

        - [ ] Improve the mathematic formulas editor in the Render Frames
        - Page started

  - [ ] Take XML created from Word as input.
  - [ ] Bibliography / Citations

        - [ ] Would it be possible to automatically link citations in the text to their corresponding entries in the bibliography?

  - [x] If I import a table or equation in EPS format, would it be selectable in Scribus?
