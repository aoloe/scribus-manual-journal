# PDF Output

## Embedded PDFs

If you have PDFs loaded in image frames (tables from external sources loaded in image frames, render frames, ...), You have the choice between:

- Including the PDFs as image, with the image being correctly processed according to the export settings.
- Embed the PDF as vectors, as they are (This is mode is considered experimental).

Only the second approach will give you selectable text in the resulting PDF.

## TODO

- Which PDF versions are requested?
