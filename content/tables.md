# Tables

Scribus tables are funky.

Importing external tables is more or less OK.

### Importing tables as PDF

You can import them by creating a  PDF in a software that have comfortable ways to create tables.

You can:

- Import them as vectors with text converted to outlines: probably rather exact, but, in the PDF, the text will not be selectable or searchable.
- Import them as vectors with text kept as is: the rendering will not be exact, but, in the PDF, the text will be selectable and searchable.
- Import them in image frames.

### Importing tables as SVG

You can import them by creating an SVG in a software that have comfortable ways to create tables.

### Using Latex and the render frames

You can create tables in the Latex render frames.

### PDF output

By default tables that are in image or render frames will be exported as images.

In order to export them as vectors (and have selectable text) you need to check the "Embed PDF & EPS files (Experimental)" option in the PDF export dialog (more information in the _PDF Output_ section.
